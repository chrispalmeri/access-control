# To do

## Layout Changes

  * add connection diagram or image
  * check that diptrace setup is repeatable
  * brief directions, plus link to Mouser project

## Code changes

  * put state in app[]? would have to pass app around more
  * include state in websocket data instead of generic 'logs updated'
  * ui switch for message channel display
  * 'gpio' package, change 'entry' to 'output'
  * increasing timeout for bad pin or card attempts
  * reboot command
  * beep or something on startup, so you know when it is ready after a power cycle
  * add control buttons on homepage, would need api first
  * users page
  * ping websocket periodically, power loss still shows connected
  * way to delete events
  * remove some columns from events table if not using them, and change 'level' to 'channel'
  * rename table from 'logs' to 'events'
  * include a default user

## Ideas

  * make a simple and an advanced version, neo is cheaper than neo core
  * slim project box instead of in-wall
  * use 3.3 from board instead of 5v divider on contacts
  * transistor or resistor arrays
