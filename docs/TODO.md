# To do

## Layout Changes

  * add connection diagram or image
  * check that diptrace setup is repeatable

## Code changes

  * add provisioning scripts
  * figure out a better development process
  * interrupt handler
  * reboot command

need to update to use libgpiod, also currently have to set pin modes manually after every reboot

`gpio mode 2 out`

`gpio mode 3 out`

`gpio mode 7 out`

`gpio mode 15 out`

## Ideas

  * make a simple and an advanced version, neo is cheaper than neo core
  * use 3.3 from board instead of 5v divider on contacts
  * transistor or resistor arrays
