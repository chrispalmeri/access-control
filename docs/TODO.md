# To do

## Layout Changes

  * add connection diagram or image
  * check that diptrace setup is repeatable

## Code changes

  * would be cool to ping websocket from within the logger directly, and clean up manual code
  * get rid of more print statements
  * increasing timeout for bad pin or card attempts
  * reboot command
  * beep or something on startup, so you know when it is ready after a power cycle

## Ideas

  * make a simple and an advanced version, neo is cheaper than neo core
  * use 3.3 from board instead of 5v divider on contacts
  * transistor or resistor arrays
