# To do

## Layout Changes

  * add connection diagram or image
  * check that diptrace setup is repeatable

## Code changes

  * refector logger init? rename myLog
  * put state in app[]? would have to pass app around more
  * include state in websocket instead of generic logs updated
  * ui switch for log level display
  * 'gpio' package, change 'entry' to 'output'
  * get rid of more print statements
  * increasing timeout for bad pin or card attempts
  * reboot command
  * beep or something on startup, so you know when it is ready after a power cycle
  * add control buttons on homepage, would need api first
  * users page
  * ping websocket periodically, power loss still shows connected
  * way to delete events

## Ideas

  * make a simple and an advanced version, neo is cheaper than neo core
  * use 3.3 from board instead of 5v divider on contacts
  * transistor or resistor arrays
